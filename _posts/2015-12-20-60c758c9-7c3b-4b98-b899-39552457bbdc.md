**How to compare funds and equities.**
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ed50ec06-a5f3-4625-b883-8131a9882126.jpg)

At Wealth Garden Wizard we like to make it easy for investors to compare equities by always showing an investor what is often called Total Return of an investment. Total return or the actual Return on Investment (ROI) is the gain or loss of capital plus any dividend or interest paid when holding an investment. 
When we compare investments in the same class, we should compare their return on investment trend lines as then it is obvious which investment is outperforming the other investments. 

For  example when we review several mutual bond Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) we can see the iShares National Mutual Bond Fund (MUB) is consistently out performing other mutual bond ETFs making it a a best in class investment for the last few years. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c41cefda-8758-4c50-a632-8aa390addf8d.png)
